# BulkSMS
Simple Android app that allows you to send unique SMS to either phone numbers from your contacts or numbers on a .csv file.
This will beat the DND implemented my various Telcos, ensuring high deliverability 

#Challenges
* No customizeble senderID
* High cost of sending :wink:

#Contribuiting
* You're more than welcome to make a pull request. 
* Let me know if you know of better SMS tariffs on telcos or contacts to strike a deal :P and how to make SenderID unique while still ensuring high deliverability
* This is my first Open Source Project and I'd really be contributing to it.
